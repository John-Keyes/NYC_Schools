# Description

    This is just a small assignment I did. It is basically just a flatlist in a container.  
    If you use this code in https://snack.expo.dev/, or in a react-native project of your own, you will be able to see it.
    You can ignore the firebase crashlytics.

# Used
  - React-Native
  - Node for Backend
