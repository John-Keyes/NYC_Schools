# Description

    This is just a small assignment I did to let you know that I understand full stack development.
    If you use this code in https://snack.expo.dev/, or in a react-native project of your own, you will be able to see it.
    You can ignore the firebase crashlytics.

# Used
  - React-Native and Expo
  - Node for Backend
  - MySQL
